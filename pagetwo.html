      <p>The one on the left is the premier league which WE won 2005 and i planning to win it next seasoning. We cant win it this season because we are in a bad shape right now.</p>
      <p>The one the right is the champions league which WE won 2022 and we are planning to win it this FEBURARY.</p>
      <P>Chelsea is the best team in the world regardless of anything people say it. Chelsea is the The First and Only London Club to Win the Champions League.They were the first London club to do it, and with the way things are shaping up across the continent right now, it could be a long time before any of their rivals can get a realistic shot to emulate their success.</P>
